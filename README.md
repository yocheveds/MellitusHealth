PhoneGap App  is designed to connect to the meter using Bluetooth, read  the data from the meter, and present the data to any medical personal

Helped diabetes patients age 65+ track their health status by developing a mobile app with several front-end features that enabled them to enter data and view results easily.  Developed the app on schedule, within budget and met all requirements for functionality, accuracy, and performance. To develop the application:

•	Collected requirements by interviewing stakeholders to define application functionality and mobile requirements, as well as front-end features, such as colors and fonts seniors could easily read.
•	Conducted extensive research to find design characteristics beneficial to seniors, such ease of the Bluetooth connection and popups to guide their use of the device.
•	Developed the app using an iterative software development approach. Continued to add functionality and make changes after meetings with stakeholders. 
•	Coded the app, in compliance with all requirements, which included changing some existing JavaScript to integrate with Bluetooth and BLE.  As a result, the app found only the Bluetooth device meter nearest to the phone.
•	Changed the frontend using framework7.
•	Modified the JavaScript to read the patient’s data through Bluetooth into the application.
•	Added pop-up messages to make the app more user-friendly.
